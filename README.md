# Key Details

EduBrawlers is created using 100% Java language with the help of Libgdx, a game engine that serves as the framework of the game. EduBrawlers is a turn-based game where each player gets the chance to choose and answer different types of questions. Specifically, mathematical equations that ranges from Each question answered correctly gains an advantage by diminishing the health (GWA) of the opposing player. The health starts at 1.00 GWA, and if the player reaches 5.00 GWA during the stage's turn, the match will end declaring the last opponent to reach the GWA limit the winner of the match
